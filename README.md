In the context of global warming, annual heat wave in the french Alps enable paragliders to land on the highest summits ("cr√©neaux mont blancs"). Indeed, clear sky, no synoptic forcing meteorological conditions are idealised days for paragliding, but also 
for the modelisation of the orographic forcing of montain circulations. This 5 month internship aims at (i) using paragliding and gliding flights to image the amospheric boundary layer in the french Alps, (ii) comparing parametrized and non parametrized 
convection models and (iii) discussing the benefit of fine resolution of non parametrized convection models. In this study, the Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) and Mesoscale Non-Hydrostatic Meso-NH atmospheric models are applied 
in the southern Alps. The evaluation and intercomparison of simulated results are conducted with the RADOME and Netatmo meteorological stations for potential temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, horizontal wind norm and with paragliding and gliding flights
for the atmospheric boundary layer height and the vertical velocity field. The simulations evaluation shows that (i) Gliding and paragliding flights are unique and valid data to efficiently cover a large spatial and temporal extent within the ABL ; 
(ii) AROME show high skill for meteorological variables, whereas Meso-NH is a performing tool to simulate vertical velocities ; (iii) A higher resolution provides a better accuracy for a given atmospheric RCMs, though AROME 1.3 km proved better than 
Meso-NH 600 m and 200 m from meteorological variables. Overall, this study highlights the necessity to incorporate new data of atmospheric dynamics within the ABL, such as paragliding and gliding flights, to allow a full evaluation and tuning of RCMs, 
in particular over mountainous areas.
